I took a full load as a first-years student and tested into 2nd-year musical fundamentals class and harmony/composition. I continued to work for FluentU and teach English to pay for school.",

My youth was slipping away and I knew that if I wanted to try to become a musician, it had to be now, rather than later. I enrolled in a regional conservatory near Paris with Hervé Noël who took me under his wing and encouraged me to continue towards that goal. I also took general courses in preparation for enrolling in a more significant degree program in the future. All the while, I was working as a teacher and, eventually, for FluentU.com to pay off my undergraduate student loans.",

      "description": "After high school I was accepted to Carleton College, a small liberal arts school in Northfield, MN. I quickly discovered many passions including acting, comedy, dance, gymnastics, figure skating, singing, and French, but it was the latter that allowed me to grow in the most formative ways, inspiring me to go on many adventures abroad, meet new people, experience new things, and delve into the unknown. I declared French as a major before finally convincing the Spanish department chair to accept my request for a romance languages major. I completed my degree in 2012 and knew that I wanted to use my language skills immediately - prompting me to move to Europe for the following three years.",

      "description": "I was lucky enough to be able to go on a second study abroad trip to Spain in my senior year. I left in June for a program that started in September, which allowed me to live for 2 months with a friend of mine in Valencia, bike the Danube river in Germany, and walk across Spain on the Way of Saint James before the program actually began. My second program was just as good as the first and at the end, I spoke better Spanish than French, which was hard for most people to believe. After the program I visited 4 more countries, not being able to resist visiting my recently adopted family in Paris, before I finally returned to the States to finish up my degree.",
