"I'm a hard-working passionate traveler from Wisconsin who has spent his life learning. That all sounds well and good, but don't take my word for it - let my actions speak for themselves. On these few pages of the interwebs I've put together an overview of my professional and personal life. I'll tell you about how I'm fluent in 3 languages, how I've walked 1061 km across northern Spain in a month, how I spent a night in the restricted catacombs of Paris, how I spent 3 years studying musical performance at conservatories in France and Belgium, and more.\nMy life has been a virtually uninterrupted stream of learning and exploration. And while the above experiences have played a huge part in making me into the person I am today, my professional goals go beyond hiking and cave-dwelling, into the realm of software and web development. Yes, in addition to English, Spanish, and French, I'm also proficient in Ruby, JavaScript, Python, and C. I created this website in the hopes of summarizing my most pertinent achievements, but they are not deserving of such brevity. Hopefully you'll get the chance to meet me and ask me more about my undertakings in person!"
