I did a lot of refactoring that separated the different sections of my site into unique controllers. Then, I used routing logic rather than loading everything and hiding unnecessary parts. I also realized that I was loading lots of JS files and wanted to clearn up my <script> tags, so I turned to Require.js which allows JS files to be loaded only when they're needed. My site is now much more readable, modularized, and responsive!"

However, I wasn't sure how to approach this problem... that is, until I discovered Sassy CSS. It was a HUGE time-saver and an organizational boon and it allowed me to think much more cleanly about style as I was writing it - using mixins and nesting. In addition to this discovery, I also developed a deeper understanding of 'the angular way' that allowed me to take some style elements (more complex animations) and work them into directives (JS proves to be a much more elegant solution than CSS for complex and/or interactive animations)."
